Rapture offers players a compromise between rules-light, exciting action, and conceptually crunchier story-centric games, with deeper characters without resorting to hundreds of pages of rules, overly complex mechanics, and dozen-page character sheets. While this game does offer a system for tabletop roleplaying, Rapture also offers several specific gameplay opportunities: Sandbox philosophies, balanced roleplaying opportunities, and collaboration between players and their referee. 

The Rapture Roleplay System, known to many of us as Rapture or even (jokingly) as Rappture, began as a failed attempt to hack the d100 (d%) system originally found in tabletop roleplaying games like TSR’s short-lived Star Frontiers. Three years later, exhausted, and looking for a breakthrough, I stumbled upon the Breathless system designed, developed, and authored by René-Pier Deshaies-Gélinas, whose minimalist game design got me thinking about Rapture in a whole new light with Breathless’ streamlined mechanics, light-weight crunch, and quick-n-dirty gameplay approach, which brought players directly into their gaming worlds/universes quicker and with little need for warm-up or stretching before doing so. 

Rapture is, at its heart, a Breathless-inspired roleplaying system. Some of the foundations for Rapture came to me when I designed my first Breathless-inspired roleplaying game for René-Pier Deshaies-Gélinas' Breathless Game Jam, back in the spring of 2022. The game was Bella Ciao!

After the game jam ended, I decided to pursue a new project, with Tyler McAlister, entitled Dragontown: City of a Billion Lost Souls. Initially, I wasn't satisfied with the design of Dragontown, nor did I feel Rapture was where I needed it to be.

Around this time, I began exploring the Free Kriegsspiel Revolution (FKR) on Discord, and within the blogosphere. It is within the FKR and its attempts to recreate those early roleplaying experiences that I discovered games like Jim Parkin's Galaxy Far Away: Ultralite Star Wars roleplaying game. (I was also introduced to Cairn and dozens of rules-light projects on marketplaces like Itch.io and Exalted Funeral.) Parkin's game gave rise to a new project for me: No One Owns the Sky, a rules-light roleplaying game that helped to further develop Rapture as a roleplaying game and system. 

In November and December 2022, Tyler McAlister and I released a more finalized version of Dragontown. It was during this release that I began to think of codifying the Rapture system, so that it, too, could become a community project, much like Breathless and the countless other systems that provided the foundations and inspirations for this project.

Around January and February of 2023, Tyler and I began planning convention attendances to showcase Rapture. This never materialized into anything actionable on our part, aside from the name of this rulebook edition: Big Red Ugly.

The Big Red Ugly Edition of Rapture started as an inside joke between Tyler and I, as both of us wanted to launch Rapture at a local, regional, or even national tabletop gaming convention. We began brainstorming unique ways to introduce this ruleset system to players who are often faced with an ever-increasing number of games on the market.

We decided on a punk-style, handmade, manifesto-look-alike rulebook to hand out
at conventions, something we called the Big Red Ugly, a play on Mao’s Little Red Book and a mashing together of different DIY and punk-style aesthetics found in games (and elsewhere). 

The Big Red Ugly Edition we envisioned would have a red-painted cover with a white
spiral binding and a black-and-white interior. Unfortunately, we moved away from producing the Big Red Ugly by hand, due to costs and logistics, but we kept the name as an inside joke meant to make us laugh and make others scratch their heads in amusement or confusion, depending on the context.

Later we launched a Kickstarter campaign in hopes of spurring some interest in the Big Red Ugly Edition, and, more specifically, in our roleplaying system, Rapture. While the Kickstarter campaign was far from breaking any records, it did help us buy artwork, get the word out, and drum up support for the alpha release of the rules (i.e., Small Red Ugly) and several resources we’d been working on since the late spring of 2022.

After a fairly decent turnout in sales and support from fans, new and old, the decision was made to revisit the Big Red Ugly for revision, editing, and limited expansion, to help others (and those who currently play) make Rapture a more permanent fixture at their gaming table. The edited, revised, and updated version of Big Red Ugly is a freebie given to those who have already purchased the previous version of the Big Red Ugly. This update is a promise from me to my fellow gamers: Rapture is going to get the support it needs, so those within the tabletop roleplaying community can thrive and grow within its ecosystem, if they so choose. 

This project would not be here without the kind support of our Kickstarter backers, our
viewers who have logged in and watched Tyler’s actual plays posted on YouTube (and on
Twitch), and those fellow designers, YouTube interviewers, and the larger tabletop roleplaying game community, who supported this project well before it was viable on its own.

And, while the digital editions (and the forthcoming print editions) of the Big Red Ugly are a bit prettier than the original handmade edition we prototyped back in the spring of 2023, we do hope some of the aesthetics and the DIY vibes are still there.
